## About

Here, I collaborated with my classmate to create a machine learning workflow for binary classification to identify if a person has heart disease or not.
The program was trained on a dataset of features such as gender, weight, resting blood pressure, and more. We used a variety of learning methods to create 
a program that would deliver accurate results. Along with the training, we conducted analysis using plots and diagrams to aid us in creating the best program. Also, I independently uploaded the model to Hugging Face.
